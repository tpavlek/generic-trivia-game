Running it
--------------

Spin up a local web server and navigate to it.

It also has a websocket server that needs to run to keep everything all speedy and up-to-date. Run `php artisan websockets:serve`
to get that up and running. It will display in the console all the messages recieved so that's a way to know if it's working.
